# Pangeo Smithy Roadmap

[Pangeo-smithy](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/pangeo-smithy) is a tool for managing pangeo-forge feedstocks. It combines a pangeo-forge recipie with the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) servcices.

Pangeo-smithy is still a work-in-progress, but when complete, it will:

- Create a git repo with a pangeo-forge recipe and the files to run pipelines builds via cloud-hosted CICD services.
- Register the repo on GitHub and push it.
- Configure the repo to use GitHub Actions CI services.
