# Staged Recipes Roadmap

[Staged-recipes](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/staged-recipes) is a GitHub repository that manages the submission of new pangeo-forge recipes. You can think of this as a holding area for new feedstocks.

Staged-recipes is still a work-in-progress, but when complete, it will:

- Include templates for new recipes.
- Manage testing, linting, and executing new recipes.
- Coordinate with pangeo-smithy to deploy new recipes into new GitHub repositories.
